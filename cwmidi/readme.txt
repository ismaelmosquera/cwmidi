The library is already build, but in case you want to rebuild it, just type:

make

from a command shell.
After build, you'll see one library in the lib folder:

cwmidi.dll

Then, you can build the examples to test them.
Maybe the library and the examples will be already compiled, but you can rebuild them if you wish.

Take in account that this library uses posix threads.
You have the MinGW installer available in a .zip file in the cwmidi repository.
There is also a brief pdf where you can find the explanations
to easily install it in your MSWindows system.
The headers in the include folder are fully documented.

We hope that you enjoy this work.
