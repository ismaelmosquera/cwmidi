This example atempts to simulate a drum machine.
It plays drums randomly; in addition, you can save your drum simulation to a SMF ( Standard MIDI File ). 
If you do not set any output filename, the drum machine simulation  will be saved as "out.mid".

The example is already compiled, but in case you want to rebuild it, just type: 

make

from a command shell.
A test program 'prog.exe' will be in the bin folder.
It's a command line application. to start it type:
cd bin
./run.sh

if you are using the MinGW Shell

or just:
cd bin
run

if you are using the cmd command line shell for windows.
